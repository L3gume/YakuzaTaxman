You live an exciting life! You are a fulltime accountant. WOW! 
One day, on your way home from your weekly hot yoga class, a 
young thuggish lad approached you with a problem: your pooch has
been kidnapped by the Yakuza. In your mediocrity, you are unable
to rescue your dog by force, so you strike a deal with the devil.
You must file the taxes for the Yakuza without error or you risk
losing your fingers, and worse, your sweet chihuahua, Juan.

You start filing their taxes. You spend hours on these taxes.
They are perfect! As you finish with the last paper, the young
yakuzaman drops another stack of sheets on your desk. That wasn't
even your final form!!

Now it is up to you, do you risk your dreams of becoming a 
professional finger picker and humiliate the Yakuza with
misfiled taxes, or do you do your freaking job and finish
filing those damn tax forms. The choice is up to you, good luck!
